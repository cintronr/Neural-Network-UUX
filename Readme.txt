In this program, I modified the Neural Network program with regard to the following:

1. Accept user input, versus preselected XOR logic values.
2. Provide a unique user interface experience.
3. Provide random characters based off of user input, and efficency of Neural Network.


This program is not perfect, and could improve in the following areas:

1. User input validation.
2. Interface (Neatness and data provided).
3. Generating values by adding a form of encryption for secret values provided.
4. Object Orientation.
